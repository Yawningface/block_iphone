# Block

**The first open-source iOS app blocker with scheduled blocking.**

Block distracting apps during the times that matter most. Set your schedule, pick your apps, and stay focused.

## Why Block?

Unlike other app blockers, Block is:

- **Open Source** - See exactly what the app does. No tracking, no ads, no subscription fees.
- **Scheduled Blocking** - Set specific time periods (e.g., 9pm-9am) when apps are blocked. Not just "block for 2 hours".
- **Persistent** - Blocking works even if you force-quit the app. Uses Apple's native Screen Time APIs.
- **Social Accountability** *(coming soon)* - Create groups with friends and stay accountable together. See each other's streaks and commitment.

## Features

- Select which apps to block using Apple's native app picker
- Set multiple blocking time periods per day
- Choose which days of the week to block
- Streak tracking to stay motivated
- Strict Mode - makes it harder to give up when you're tempted
- Clean, dark UI

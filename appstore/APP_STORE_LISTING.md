## Description

**Take back your focus with YawningFace.**

YawningFace is the first open-source app blocker with scheduled blocking. Unlike other blockers that only let you block "for 2 hours," YawningFace lets you set specific time periods—like 9pm to 9am—when your distracting apps are blocked.

**HOW IT WORKS**

1. Choose apps to block - Select from all your installed apps using Apple's native picker
2. Set your schedule - Pick time periods and days of the week
3. Stay focused - Apps are blocked automatically during your scheduled times

**KEY FEATURES**

• Scheduled blocking - Block apps during specific hours (e.g., 9pm-9am)
• Persistent blocking - Works even if you force-quit the app
• Multiple time periods - Set different blocking windows
• Streak tracking - Stay motivated with daily streaks
• Strict Mode - Makes it harder to give up when tempted
• Privacy-first - All data stays on your device

**WHY PACT?**

• Open source - See exactly how it works
• No subscription - Free forever
• No tracking - We literally can't see your data
• No ads - Clean, focused experience
• Native Apple APIs - Uses Screen Time for reliable blocking

**COMING SOON**

• Social accountability - Create groups with friends
• See each other's streaks and commitment
• Stay accountable together

**REQUIREMENTS**

• iOS 16 or later
• Screen Time permissions

## App Review Notes

*Include for Apple reviewers:*

```
This app uses the Family Controls framework to block user-selected apps during scheduled time periods.

To test:
1. Grant Screen Time permission when prompted
2. Tap "Get Started" to create a schedule
3. Select apps to block using the app picker
4. Set time period (e.g., current time + 5 minutes for testing)
5. Enable the schedule
6. Try opening a blocked app - it will show Apple's shield screen

The blocking is fully reversible:
- Users can disable blocking from the Blocks tab
- Users can modify their schedule anytime
- Strict Mode adds friction but doesn't prevent disabling

No data leaves the device. The app has no server component.
